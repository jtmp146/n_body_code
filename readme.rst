Welcome

This is James Mackenzie Page's readme file for a simulation of the motion 
of n massive bodies under Newtonian gravity. The program simulates merging
of masses when they come within a certain distance of each other. The 
simulation is based on Euler's method for numerically solving differential
equations and uses Python's multiprocessing package. The simulated motion 
is displayed as a 3D animation.
